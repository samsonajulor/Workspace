// what is the big o notation
// this is the estimated time taken for a code to run successfully. It is used to determine the efficiency of a code.
// a tool that is used to determine the time complexity of an algorithm.
// 1. constant time O(1)
// constant time is when the time it takes to run the algorithm is the same regardless of the size of the input.
// 2. linear time O(n)
// linear time is when the time it takes to run the algorithm is directly proportional to the size of the input.
// for example the following function:
// 3. quadratic time O(n^2)
// quadratic time is when the time it takes to run the algorithm
// is proportional to the square of the size of the input.
// 4. logarithmic time O(log n)
// logarithmic time is when the time it takes to run
//the algorithm is proportional to the logarithm of the size of the input.
// what this means is that if it takes 1 second to run 10 elements it will take 2 seconds to run 100 elements, 3 seconds to run 1000 elements and so on.
