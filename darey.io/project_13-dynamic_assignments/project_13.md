# Introducing Dynamic Assignment Into Our structure
- In your https://github.com/<your-name>/ansible-config-mgt GitHub repository start a new branch and call it dynamic-assignments.

- Create a new folder, name it dynamic-assignments. Then inside this folder, create a new file and name it env-vars.yml. We will instruct site.yml to include this playbook later. For now, let us keep building up the structure.

![created a new branch](./images/created%20a%20new%20branch.jpg)

- Your GitHub shall have following structure by now.

---
├── dynamic-assignments
│   └── env-vars.yml
├── inventory
│   └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
└── playbooks
    └── site.yml
└── roles (optional folder)
    └──...(optional subfolders & files)
└── static-assignments
    └── common.yml
---

---
Note: Depending on what method you used in the previous project you may have or not have roles folder in your GitHub repository – if you used ansible-galaxy, then roles directory was only created on your Jenkins-Ansible server locally. It is recommended to have all the codes managed and tracked in GitHub, so you might want to recreate this structure manually in this case – it is up to you.
---

Since we will be using the same Ansible to configure multiple environments, and each of these environments will have certain unique attributes, such as servername, ip-address etc., we will need a way to set values to variables per specific environment.

- For this reason, we will now create a folder to keep each environment’s variables file. Therefore, create a new folder env-vars, then for each environment, create new YAML files which we will use to set variables.

Your layout should now look like this.

---
├── dynamic-assignments
│   └── env-vars.yml
├── env-vars
    └── dev.yml
    └── stage.yml
    └── uat.yml
    └── prod.yml
├── inventory
    └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
├── playbooks
    └── site.yml
└── static-assignments
    └── common.yml
    └── webservers.yml
---

- Now paste the instruction below into the env-vars.yml file.

```
---
- name: collate variables from env specific file, if it exists
  hosts: all
  tasks:
    - name: looping through list of available files
      include_vars: "{{ item }}"
      with_first_found:
        - files:
            - dev.yml
            - stage.yml
            - prod.yml
            - uat.yml
          paths:
            - "{{ playbook_dir }}/../env-vars"
      tags:
        - always
```

- Notice 3 things to notice here:

- We used include_vars syntax instead of include, this is because Ansible developers decided to separate different features of the module. From Ansible version 2.8, the include module is deprecated and variants of include_* must be used. These are:

```
include_role
include_tasks
include_vars
```

In the same version, variants of import were also introduced, such as:

```
import_role
import_tasks
```

- We made use of a special variables { playbook_dir } and { inventory_file }. { playbook_dir } will help Ansible to determine the location of the running playbook, and from there navigate to other path on the filesystem. { inventory_file } on the other hand will dynamically resolve to the name of the inventory file being used, then append .yml so that it picks up the required file within the env-vars folder.

- We are including the variables using a loop. with_first_found implies that, looping through the list of files, the first one found is used. This is good so that we can always set default values in case an environment specific env file does not exist.

## Update site.yml with dynamic assignments
- Update site.yml file to make use of the dynamic assignment. (At this point, we cannot test it yet. We are just setting the stage for what is yet to come. So hang on to your hats)

site.yml should now look like this.

```
---
- hosts: all
- name: Include dynamic variables 
  tasks:
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml 
  include: ../dynamic-assignments/env-vars.yml
  tags:
    - always

-  hosts: webservers
- name: Webserver assignment
  import_playbook: ../static-assignments/uat-webservers.yml
```

## Community Roles
Now it is time to create a role for MySQL database – it should install the MySQL package, create a database and configure users. But why should we re-invent the wheel? There are tons of roles that have already been developed by other open source engineers out there. These roles are actually production ready, and dynamic to accommodate most of Linux flavours. With Ansible Galaxy again, we can simply download a ready to use ansible role, and keep going.

### Download Mysql Ansible Role
- You can browse available community roles [here](https://galaxy.ansible.com/home)

- We will be using a [MySQL role developed by geerlingguy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/mysql).

Hint: To preserve your your GitHub in actual state after you install a new role – make a commit and push to master your ‘ansible-config-mgt’ directory. Of course you must have git installed and configured on Jenkins-Ansible server and, for more convenient work with codes, you can configure Visual Studio Code to work with this directory. In this case, you will no longer need webhook and Jenkins jobs to update your codes on Jenkins-Ansible server, so you can disable it – we will be using Jenkins later for a better purpose.

- On Jenkins-Ansible server make sure that git is installed with git --version, then go to ‘ansible-config-mgt’ directory and run

```
git init
git pull https://github.com/<your-name>/ansible-config-mgt.git
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-name>/ansible-config-mgt.git
git branch roles-feature
git switch roles-feature
```

- Inside roles directory create your new MySQL role with `ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.mysql` and rename the folder to mysql

`mv /home/samsonajulor/.ansible/roles/geerlingguy.mysql/ /home/samsonajulor/.ansible/roles/mysql`

- Read README.md file, and edit roles configuration to use correct credentials for MySQL required for the tooling website.
Now it is time to upload the changes into your GitHub:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Commit new role files into GitHub"
git push --set-upstream origin roles-feature
Now, if you are satisfied with your codes, you can create a Pull Request and merge it to main branch on GitHub.
```
